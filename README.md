## General Information
To analyse and predict the demand of BoomBikes with the data provided

Factors affecting the demand for shared bikes in the American market
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
- How well do those variables describe the bike demands


## Conclusions

The Multiple Linear Regression model

- A Linear Regression model built on the target variable -count
- Split the data into Training dataset and Test dataset
- Perform the RÂ² score on the test dataset
- Prediction of demand/count, Model building, and Evaluation
